<p>KeepClose is designed to help families stay connected through scheduled voice reminders. Your privacy is fundamental to how the app works.</p>

<li>Audio is automatically deleted immediately after it is played.</li>
<li>If a message is not played, it is automatically removed after a short system-defined period.</li>
<li>KeepClose does not maintain an archive of recordings.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data We Collect</h2>
<p>We collect only the minimal information required to operate the service, such as account details and reminder scheduling metadata.</p>

<h2>What We Do NOT Do</h2>
<ul>
<li>We do not sell your data.</li>
<li>We do not use recordings for advertising.</li>
<li>We do not analyze or train AI models using your voice.</li>
